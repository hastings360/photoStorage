It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn(scheduler, delay = 0) {\n    return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source) {\n        return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n    };\n}\nexport class ObserveOnOperator {\n    constructor(scheduler, delay = 0) {\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    call(subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n    }\n}\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber extends Subscriber {\n    constructor(destination, scheduler, delay = 0) {\n        super(destination);\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    static dispatch(arg) {\n        const { notification, destination } = arg;\n        notification.observe(destination);\n        this.unsubscribe();\n    }\n    scheduleMessage(notification) {\n        this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch, this.delay, new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)));\n    }\n    _next(value) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n    }\n    _error(err) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n    }\n    _complete() {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n    }\n}\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\n    constructor(notification, destination) {\n        this.notification = notification;\n        this.destination = destination;\n    }\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map",null]}
